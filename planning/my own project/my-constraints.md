# Constraints

Some limitations about my project.

## External

- Tight deadline
- Little experience with html & css

<!--
  constraints coming from the outside that your team has no control over. these may include:
  - project deadlines
  - UI design or color schemes
  - technologies (sometimes a client will tell you what to use)
-->

## Internal: Involuntary

- Mixed availability.  
- Mixed skill levels.  
- Technical limitations  still have issues setting up their computer.
  
<!--
  constraints that come from within you, and you have no control over. they may include:
  - each of your individual skill levels
  - amount of time available to work on the project
-->

## Internal: Voluntary

- Simplify the website as the original is coded in React.
- Preference for learning instead of perfect code.

<!--
  constraints that you decided on to help scope the project. they may include:
  - coding style & conventions
  - the number of hours you want to spend working
  - only using the colors black and white
  - technologies (sometimes you can choose what to use)
